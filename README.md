# Advent of Code - 2024
## Tyler McDonald
These are my submissions for the Advent of Code 2024 programming challenges. My initial goal was to do these problems in MIPS - while a great language, this takes a *considerable* amount of effort, and as such I've left it until the New Year when I have some more time.

Meanwhile, as a consolation prize for my efforts, I'm using this as an opportunity to learn Rust! Don't expect optimized solutions, but this serves as a great chance for me to get my feet wet.

**Obviously, this goes without saying, but there are spoilers ahead!**
